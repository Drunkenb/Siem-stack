The idea behind this project is to facilitate testing of <a href="https://github.com/socfortress">SOCFortress' Open Source SIEM Stack</a>. This is by no means production safe security-wise, 
and only intended to get people started in a lab environment. This project is licensed under GPLv3 which means you can use and modify in it any way you like, so long as you keep it under the same 
licensing scheme. If you don't feel confortable making necessary changes for moving into production you can get in touch with us and we will help you get there.
